# Making a Weather & Prayers timer app with public API

it's a very simple and easy to make app, But i was planning to make for real since we need both of weather forecast and times of daily prayers.

# TODO

**MUST-have:**
- [x] Current Time and date.
- [x] Location details (City, Continent).
- [x] Icons & Future forecast status
- [ ] Search bar
- [x] Prayers time
- [ ] Change the forecast details according to chosen city in the search bar 

- # NICE-to-have:
1- changeable background according to the weather status
2- more details about sunset, sunrise, ..etc.
3- looks real and great
