# Making a Weather & Prayers timer app with public API

it's a very simple and easy to make app, But i was planning to make for real since we need both of weather forecast and times of daily prayers.

# TODO

**MUST-have:**
- Current Time and date.
- Location details (City, Continent).
3- Icons & Future forecast status
4- Search bar
5- Prayers time
6- Change the forecast details according to chosen city in the search bar 

- # NICE-to-have:
1- changeable background according to the weather status
2- more details about sunset, sunrise, ..etc.
3- looks real and great
